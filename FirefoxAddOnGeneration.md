#Creating a .xpi

## Creating a .crx
1. Install the GenderMag Recorder's Assistant using the README.md steps
2. Once the extension is loaded, generate the .crx by clicking 'Pack extension'
3. Select the GenderMagRecorderAssistant-master directory
4. The first time you pack the assistant, leave the 'Private Key' field blank. This will prompt you to be asked to create a private key which will generate a PEM file. Subsiquent packings of the extension will use this key. 
5. Click "Pack Extension". If you have previously created a .crx, you will be asked to confirm that you want to proceed and save over your previous .crx.

## Converting the .crx to .xpi
