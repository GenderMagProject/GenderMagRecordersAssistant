			<span id="patrickRToolTipComplete" hidden> 
				Pat is <span style="color:red;"><u>risk averse</u></span> when he uses computers to perform tasks. When confronted with new software features, Pat worries that he will spend time on them and not get any benefits from doing so. He prefers to perform tasks "the safe" (ie, familiar) way if possible, even if less familiar features might promise a more direct solution.
