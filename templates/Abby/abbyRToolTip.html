		<span id="abbyRToolTipComplete" hidden> 
			Abby is <span style="color:red;">risk averse</span> when she uses computers to perform tasks. When confronted with new software features, Abby worries that she will spend time on them and not get any benefits from doing so. She tries to perform tasks "the safe” (ie, familiar) way, even if the less familiar features might promise a more direct solution.
