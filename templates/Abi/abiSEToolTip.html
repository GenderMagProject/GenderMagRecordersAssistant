				<span style="color:red;">low self-confidence in performing 
				computing tasks</span>

				<span class="verb-other"></span> software. For example, Abi is 
				not confident that <span class="pronoun">they</span> can learn 
				to use new features and, as self-efficacy theory explains,
				<span class="pronoun">they</span> often give
				<span class="verb-other"></span> up if they run into 
				challenges. Software with usability problems
				poses more challenges to her than it does to more confident 
				users, and <span class="pronoun">they</span> often blame
				<span class="verb-other"></span>
				<span class="possessive">their</span>self for problems that
				<span class="pronoun">they</span> encounter
				<span class="verb-other"></span>.
