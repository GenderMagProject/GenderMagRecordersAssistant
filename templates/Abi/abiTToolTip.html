				Abi doesn't like to tinker with software, which means that 
				<span class="pronoun">they</span> might not find features that 
				aren't apparent. Abi would rather follow step-by-step 
				tutorials, and typically avoids troublesome features or 
				commands.

				Abi <span style="color:red;">doesn't particularly like 
				tinkering with software</span> (ie, just trying out new 
				features or commands to see what they do) when
				<span class="pronoun">they</span> use
				<span class="verb-other"></span> software in 
				<span class="possessive">their</span> work tasks. Instead,
				<span class="pronoun">they</span> prefer
				<span class="verb-other"></span>
				<span style="color:red;"><u>following step-by-step tutorials 
				and wizards.</u></span> (However, when Abi does tinker, it has 
				positive effects on <span class="possessive">their</span> 
				understanding of the software.) When software features/commands
				 cause problems for Abi, <span class="pronoun">they</span>
				<span style="color:red;"><u>tend
				<span class="verb-other"></span> to blame
				<span class="possessive">their</span></u></span>self and, if 
				<span class="pronoun">they</span> can, Abi then 
				<span style="color:red;"><u> just avoids those troublesome 
				features/commands.</u></span> Abi then uses work-arounds that 
				involve using <span style="color:red;"><u>only 
				features/commands <span class="pronoun">they</span> 
				<span class="verb-is">are</span> familiar with already.</u>
