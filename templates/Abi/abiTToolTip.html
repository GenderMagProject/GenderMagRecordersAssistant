		<span id="abiTToolTipComplete">
		Abi <span style="color:red;">doesn't particularly like tinkering with software</span>
			(ie, just trying out new features or commands to see what they do) when
			<span class="pronoun">they</span> use<span class="verb-other"></span>
			software in <span class="possessive">their</span> work tasks. Instead,
			<span class="pronoun">they</span> prefer<span class="verb-other"></span>
			<span style="color:red;"><u>following step-by-step tutorials and wizards.</u></span>
			(However, when Abi does tinker, it has positive effects on
			<span class="possessive">their</span> understanding of the software.)
			When software features/commands cause problems for Abi, <span class="pronoun">they</span>
			<span style="color:red;"><u>tend<span class="verb-other"></span> to blame
				<span class="possessive">their</span></u></span>self and, if
			<span class="pronoun">they</span> can, Abi then <span style="color:red;"><u>
			just avoids those troublesome features/commands.</u></span> Abi then
			uses work-arounds that involve using <span style="color:red;"><u>only features/commands
			<span class="pronoun">they</span> <span class="verb-is">are</span> familiar with already.</u></span>
