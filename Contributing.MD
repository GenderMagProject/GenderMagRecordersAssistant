# GenderMag Recorder's Assistant Contributing Guide

## Git Resources

* Please review the resources available at https://try.github.io/ if you are not already familiar with Git/GitHub or need a reference for Git terms and commands as you prepare to contribute.

## How to install and edit:

 1. Install the tool via instructions in the README

 2. If you want to run the tool at this point, navigate to the page you wish to perform GenderMag on and click the maroon GenderMag button at the bottom of the screen. The video posted at http://gendermag.org has an example.
 3. Open the project files in an editor, like Intellij, or whatever you perfer.
 4. Make and save edits.
 5. To view and test your edits, navigate to “Extensions”, which has a triple dot icon, at the top right corner of the broswer. Then, hover over 'More Tools' and click on Extentions. 
 6. After that, you might have to hit the refresh button (↻) and reload the page where you are using the tool.

## To Contribute:
  1. Create a new branch to work on. 
      * Ex: The command `git branch test` creates a new branch called test.
  2. Use `git checkout [name of branch]` to switch to that branch.
  3. Navigate to the place you stored your local copy of the GenderMagsRecordersAssistant (the copy that you cloned to your local desktop)
4.	To look for issues you can contribute to navigate back to the original GenderMag repo, not your forked repo, and look at the issues under the issue tab on the top.
      * You can also filter the issues by the "Good first issue" tag to get started.
5.	Make any new changes or fixes on your branch and then push the branch to your remote repo.
6.	Then make a pull request using [this guide](https://github.com/mendezc1/GenderMagRecordersAssistant/blob/master/Recorder's%20Assistant%20Testing_Pull%20Request%20Guide%20.pdf).
     * If you have questions on how to push, pull, and commit check out the [guide](https://github.com/git-guides/) GitHub has posted.

Before you push your changes, check out our [style guidelines](https://github.com/GenderMagProject/GenderMagRecordersAssistant/blob/master/style_guidelines.md). This will inform you on how to write code and comments that are consistent with the rest of the code in the repo.

You will hear back from us soon!
