## What is the GenderMag Recorder's Assistant?

The GenderMag Recorder’s Assistant is a tool to identify gender-inclusiveness issues in software. [GenderMag](http://gendermag.org/) is a process you can use to find gender biases in user-facing software that you are designing/building. The GenderMag Recorder’s Assistant semi-automates using this process. It is easy to use and can be used by software engineers to management to usability experts.

If you want to help make software gender-inclusive, one way is to contribute to the GenderMag Recorder’s Assistant.

## How to Run the Tool

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to run the Recorder Assistant tool: 

   a) To begin a gender mag session, first provide a name to the scenario that your persona will be performing.
 
   b) After inputting the name of the scenario (For example: submitting a timesheet) into the text field, click the submit
    button. 
    
   c) Create a subgoal to proceed with the process. 
    
   d) Enter an action that pertains to this subgoal. 
   
   * i) Choose and then input the action the persona would perform next and type that action into the text field. At
         this point the action field ui should appear.
         
   * ii) The action field ui will ask you if the personal will know what to do at this step. Select “yes,” “no,” or
         “maybe” from the radio buttons and put your explanation in the text box field.
         
   * iii) The action field ui will prompt you to choose which of the persona’s facets are used to answer the question
          from (ii). Select the radio buttons that apply.
         
   e) After the action fields have been completed an after-action ui prompt will continue the process.

   * i) You will be prompted to evaluate if the persona thinks the action they have completed was the right thing to
   do. Select “yes,” “no,” or “maybe” from the radio buttons and put your explanation in the text box.
          
   * ii) The after-action field ui will prompt you to choose which of the persona’s facets are used to answer the
   question from (i). Select the radio buttons that apply.
          
   f) If your persona needs another action to complete the current subgoal, return to (d) and do the steps pertinent to (d)
    and (e).
    
   g) If the subgoal is complete, but another subgoal is needed to complete the scenario, return to (c) and complete the
    steps following.
    
   h) If the scenario has been completed, you are finished and may exit the tool.

See the video at http://gendermag.org for examples of what running the tool looks like.
