# How to Run a GenderMag Session Using the Tool
A GenderMag session is simply an instance of using the GenderMag method. If 
you have downloaded and installed the tool and want to run it, make sure the 
extension is enabled, navigate to the page you wish to perform GenderMag on 
and click the GenderMag button at the bottom of the screen. 

See the [video](http://gendermag.org/genderMag.html) from GenderMag.org for examples 
and/or read the guide below.

Here is a step-by-step guide on how to run the Recorder Assistant tool: 

   1) After you have installed the GenderMag recorder's assistance extension a 
   maroon button will appear on the bottom middle of the screen. Click it to 
   open the tool.
      
   2) After clicking on the maroon button, text explaining what GenderMag is 
   will appear on the screen. Click on "Start GenderMag" to get started.
      
   3) Enter the name of your team and click submit.
   
   4) Select the persona that you want to use for this session. 
      Currently, you can select from these personas: Abi, Tim, Pat, or a custom persona of your creation.
      
      After you have selected the persona, the description of the selected 
      persona you selected will appear to the right.
      
      * If you selected a custom persona, navigate to http://gendermag.org/custom_persona.php and design your custom persona using an online or PDF form. Your custom persona's facets and characteristics will be listed on these forms instead of in the GenderMag extension.

      If you want to change the persona or team name, click edit on top of the 
      tool.
   
   5) Provide the scenario that your persona will be performing in the text box 
   and click submit.
    
   6) Enter a subgoal and click 'enter subgoal'. 
   
   7) Answer Yes, No, or Maybe to describe if the persona would have formed this
    subgoal as a step to their overall goal. In the text box, explain 
    why, why not, or why maybe. On the right of that text box, select all the 
    checkboxes corresponding to the facets that were used to answer the previous
    question. Then click save and continue.
    
   8) Enter an action that pertains to this subgoal. 
   
   9) Click on the 'click here' button to take a screen capture of ideal action. 
   Move the rectangular box around your box to the action that you want to focus 
   on and hit the left click. This will create a screen capture of ideal action. 
   If you want to add more info to the capture click on the draw on the image 
   button and annotate the image. If the image looks okay, click 'save and 
   continue'.

   10) Answer: Yes, No, or Maybe for, will the persona know what to do at this 
   step, and in the text box under it explain why, why not, or why maybe? On 
   the right of that textbox select all the checkboxes against the facets that 
   were used to answer the previous question.

   11) Perform the action you indicated previously in step 9 and click on the 
   'click here' link to continue.
   
   12) Answer: Yes, No, or Maybe for, if the persona did the right thing will 
   she know that they did the right thing, and is making progress towards the 
   goal and in the textbox under it explain why, why not, or why maybe? On the 
   right of that textbox select all the checkboxes against the facets that were
   used to answer the previous question. Click 'save and continue' when ready.
       
   13) If your persona needs another action to complete the current subgoal, 
   enter the new action in the top text box and click 'add another action'. 
   Return to (9) and complete all subsequent steps.
   
   14) If the subgoal is complete, but another subgoal is needed to complete 
   the scenario, enter the subgoal in the bottom text box and click 'create new 
   subgoal'. Return to (7) and complete all subsequent steps. 
    
   15) If the scenario has been completed, click 'download and end my GenderMag 
   session'. This will take you to another page and download a zip file with 
   your session's information.
   
   16) If the zip file was not downloaded click Re-Download zip file. Otherwise,
    check the box next to the disclaimer saying that the file was downloaded and
    hit "Quit GenderMag". This will reload the page and close the tool.

looks like.

3. Why should GenderMag be used?
    * Gender biases within software indirectly discourage people of marginalized genders from engaging with technology. Software that isn't inclusive for all genders loses out on an enormous market of paying consumers and potential technological contributors. By addressing these gender biases, GenderMag helps improve software experiences for end-users of any genders.
